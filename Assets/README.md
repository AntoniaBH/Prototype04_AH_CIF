This narrative-driven game explores the themes of Impermanence & Eternalism, immersing players in a world where past, present, and future overlap. After experiencing an abnormal event, Lysandra—a scientist burdened by guilt and fragmented memories—is left shaken up, when her past begins to catch up to her and when anomalies continue to unfold, she begins to question her own perception of reality and how to deal with the events happening around her. Through dialogue-driven choices and exploration, players can uncover the mystery behind Project Elysium and confront the consequences of their discoveries. But as time unravels around Lysandra, one question remains—can she trust what she sees, or is reality slipping through her fingers?
